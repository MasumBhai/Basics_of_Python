Riding in my spaceship what do I see?
What do I see? What do I see?
One strange alien looking at me,
Looking at me, looking at me.
Its eyes are purple and its hair is green,
It's the funniest alien I've ever seen!

And we can walk like an alien, walk like an alien,
Walk like an alien, walk like an alien,
Talk like an alien, talk like an alien,
Talk like an alien.
(Alien talking noise)

Riding in my spaceship what do I see?
What do I see? What do I see?
Two strange aliens looking at me,
Looking at me, looking at me.
Their eyes are purple and their hair is green,
They're the funniest aliens I've ever seen!

And we can swim like an alien, swim like an alien,
Swim like an alien, swim like an alien,
Sing like an alien, sing like an alien,
Sing like an alien.
(Alien singing noise)

Riding in my spaceship what do I see?
What do I see? What do I see?
Three strange aliens looking at me,
Looking at me, looking at me.
Their eyes are purple and their hair is green,
They're the funniest aliens I've ever seen!

And we can scratch like an alien, scratch like an alien,
Scratch like an alien, scratch like an alien,
Yawn like an alien, yawn like an alien,
Yawn like an alien.
(Alien yawning noise)

Riding in my spaceship what do I see?
What do I see? What do I see?
Four strange aliens looking at me,
Looking at me, looking at me.
Their eyes are purple and their hair is green,
They're the funniest aliens I've ever seen!

And we can shuffle like an alien, shuffle like an alien,
Shuffle like an alien, shuffle like an alien,
Laugh like an alien, laugh like an alien,
Laugh like an alien.
(Alien laughing noise)

Riding in my spaceship what do I see?
What do I see? What do I see?
Five strange aliens looking at me,
Looking at me, looking at me.
Their eyes are purple and their hair is green,
They're the funniest aliens I've ever seen!

And we can shake like an alien, shake like an alien,
Shake like an alien, shake like an alien,
Sigh like an alien, sigh like an alien,
Sigh like an alien.
(Alien sighing noise)

Lookin' in the mirror what do I see?
What do I see? What do I see?
One strange alien looking at me,
Looking at me, looking at me.
My eyes are purple and my hair is green,
I'm the funniest alien I've ever seen!

Doing the alien shuffle in outer space!
